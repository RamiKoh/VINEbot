# VINEbot
_AI ChatBot using Python and TensorFlow._
 <div style="text-align: justify">
First project in Deep Learning. The idea I was initially going for involved no AI; I only wanted a fun chatbot that would occasionnaly throw some vine references in the conversation depending on the keywords detected. Thought I might as well try AI at the same time. For now I'm using the following tutorial as reference, but will eventually diverge from it once I feel comfortable enough. Wish me luck. Also the bot's alternative name is BRObot.
